## Shift Pattern

Each team follows a 10-day repeating cycle:
- **Days 1-2**: Morning shift (07:00-15:00) - Code: M
- **Days 3-4**: Evening shift (15:00-23:00) - Code: E
- **Days 5-6**: Night shift (23:00-07:00) - Code: N
- **Days 7-10**: Off days

Teams are numbered 1-5, with each team starting their cycle 2 days after the previous team.

## Date Format

Dates are displayed in **YYWW.D** format where:
- **YY** = Last 2 digits of year (25 = 2025)
- **WW** = Week number (20 = week 20)  
- **D** = Weekday (1=Monday, 2=Tuesday...7=Sunday)

Examples:
- Tuesday, May 13, 2025 = `2520.2` (year 2025, week 20, Tuesday)
- Morning shift: `2520.2M`
- Evening shift: `2520.2E` 
- Night shift: `2520.1N` (uses previous day for night starting at 23:00)
