# NextShift - Team Shift Tracker

**Created by [Jorim Tielemans](https://github.com/tjorim)** 

A lightweight, offline-capable Progressive Web App (PWA) for tracking 5-team continuous (24/7) shift schedules.

## Overview

NextShift helps teams working in a 5-team rotating shift system to quickly check:
- Which teams are working on any given day
- When their next shift is scheduled
- Transfer/handover points between teams
- Complete schedule overview with easy navigation

## Features

### 🕐 Current Status
- Real-time display of your team's current shift
- Next shift countdown and scheduling
- Date display in YYWW.D format (e.g., 2520.2M = year 2025, week 20, Tuesday Morning)

### 👥 Team Management
- Team selection on first visit (stored locally)
- Highlight your team across all views
- Easy team switching

### 📅 Schedule Views
- **Today**: All 5 teams' current shifts
- **Schedule**: 7-day calendar view with navigation
- **Transfers**: Find handover/takeover points between teams

### 📱 PWA Features
- **Offline Support**: Works without internet connection
- **Installable**: Add to home screen on mobile devices
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with Bootstrap 5
- **Fast**: Cached for instant loading

## Shift Pattern

Each team follows a 10-day repeating cycle:
- **Days 1-2**: Morning shift (07:00-15:00) - Code: M
- **Days 3-4**: Evening shift (15:00-23:00) - Code: E
- **Days 5-6**: Night shift (23:00-07:00) - Code: N
- **Days 7-10**: Off days

Teams are numbered 1-5, with each team starting their cycle 2 days after the previous team.

## Date Format

Dates are displayed in **YYWW.D** format where:
- **YY** = Last 2 digits of year (25 = 2025)
- **WW** = Week number (20 = week 20)  
- **D** = Weekday (1=Monday, 2=Tuesday...7=Sunday)

Optional shift code suffixes (M/E/N) can be added to specify the shift type:

Examples:
- Tuesday, May 13, 2025 = `2520.2` (year 2025, week 20, Tuesday)
- Morning shift: `2520.2M`
- Evening shift: `2520.2E` 
- Night shift: `2520.1N` (uses previous day for night starting at 23:00)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tjorim/NextShift.git
   cd NextShift
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
   - Select your team when prompted
   - Start tracking your shifts!

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to any static hosting service.

### PWA Installation

- **Desktop**: Click the installation button in your browser's address bar
- **Mobile**: Use "Add to Home Screen" from your browser menu
- **Offline**: Once installed, the app works completely offline

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Configure reference variables for shift calculations using environment variables or runtime configuration:

```bash
# Development (.env file)
VITE_REFERENCE_DATE=2025-01-06
VITE_REFERENCE_TEAM=1

# Production build
VITE_REFERENCE_DATE=2025-01-13 VITE_REFERENCE_TEAM=3 npm run build
```

### Runtime Configuration

Alternatively, configure at runtime by adding to your HTML before the main script:

```javascript
window.NEXTSHIFT_CONFIG = {
    REFERENCE_DATE: '2025-01-06',
    REFERENCE_TEAM: 1
};
```

These variables anchor all shift calculations to your specific schedule. If not configured, defaults to `2025-01-06` and team `1`.

### Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build

# Code Quality
npm run lint         # Run Biome linter
npm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run format       # Format code
npm run test         # Run test suite
```
