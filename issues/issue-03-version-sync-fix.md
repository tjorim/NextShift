## Version Sync Fix

**Component**: Changelog version alignment

### Description
Synchronize version numbers between the application's package.json, changelog display, and future planning sections to ensure accurate 'Coming Soon' version displays and proper roadmap versioning.

### User Stories

- As a developer, I want version numbers to be consistent across all documentation so there's no confusion about release planning

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Future plans show realistic and sequential version numbers
- [ ] 'Coming Soon' features reference correct upcoming version numbers
- [ ] Version numbering follows semantic versioning principles
- [ ] Changelog dates align with realistic development timeline

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] src/components/ChangelogModal.tsx - Ensure version display consistency

### Dependencies
- Current package.json version (3.2.1)
- Existing changelog structure

### Technical Details
