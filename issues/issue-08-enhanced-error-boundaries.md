## Enhanced Error Boundaries

**Component**: More granular error handling with component-specific error boundaries

### Description
Implement additional error boundaries for complex components to provide better error recovery, more informative error messages, and graceful degradation when components fail.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want the app to continue working when one component fails so my entire experience isn't disrupted
- As a developer, I want detailed error information so I can diagnose and fix issues more effectively
- As a support person, I want users to see helpful error messages so they can understand what went wrong

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Critical components have individual error boundaries
- [ ] Error boundaries provide user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Failed components can be retried without full page reload
- [ ] Error reporting includes component context and error details
- [ ] Graceful degradation maintains app functionality where possible
- [ ] Error boundaries don't interfere with development error overlay

### Technical Requirements
- Strategic placement of error boundaries around complex components
- Error reporting integration with existing error handling
- User-friendly error UI components
- Retry mechanisms for recoverable errors
- Development vs production error display modes

### Implementation
**Approach**: Add focused error boundaries around key components

### Files to Modify

- [ ] src/components/ScheduleView.tsx - Add error boundary protection
- [ ] src/components/ShiftTimeline.tsx - Add error boundary protection
- [ ] tests/components/error/ - Test suite for error handling

### Dependencies
- Existing ErrorBoundary component
- React error boundary patterns
- React Bootstrap Alert components

### Technical Details
- **Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Priority**: medium
- **Milestone**: v3.4.0
