## PWA Installation Prompts

**Component**: Intelligent installation timing and enhanced prompts

### Description
Enhance the existing usePWAInstall hook to provide better onboarding integration, smart prompt timing based on user engagement, and installation success tracking.

### User Stories
- As a new user, I want to be prompted to install the app at an appropriate time so I'm not interrupted during my first experience
- As a returning user, I want smart prompts that consider my usage patterns so I'm only asked when it makes sense
- As a user who dismissed the prompt, I want easy access to install later so I can change my mind

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Installation prompts appear after user engagement threshold is met
- [ ] Prompts respect user dismissal and don't repeatedly interrupt
- [ ] Manual installation option is always available in settings
- [ ] Installation success/failure is tracked and reported
- [ ] Prompts are contextually relevant and well-timed
- [ ] Works across different browsers and platforms
