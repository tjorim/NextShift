## Notification System Implementation

**Component**: Comprehensive push notification and reminder system

### Description
Build a complete notification system with shift reminders, countdown alerts, and push notifications for PWA installations, leveraging existing notification settings in SettingsContext.

### User Stories
- As a shift worker, I want to receive notifications before my shift starts so I never miss work
- As a busy professional, I want customizable notification timing so I can set reminders that work with my schedule
- As a PWA user, I want push notifications even when the app is closed so I'm always informed

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can set shift reminder notifications (15min, 1hr, 2hr before shift)
- [ ] Push notifications work when PWA is installed and app is closed
- [ ] Notification permissions are requested appropriately
- [ ] Users can customize notification preferences per shift type
- [ ] Notifications include relevant shift information (time, type, duration)
- [ ] Notification system respects browser and system do-not-disturb settings
- [ ] Graceful fallback for browsers without notification support

### Technical Requirements
